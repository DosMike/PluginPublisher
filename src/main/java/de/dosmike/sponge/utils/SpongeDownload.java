/**
 * In the latest <a href="https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/sponge-status-update-12th-december-2019/34368">Sponge Update</a>
 * the Sponge team decided that for your Plugins to be approved, the following conditions must be also be met by the project:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Downloaded content must have hard-coded SHA256 (or better) based hash checking
 * <li>Downloaded content must be explained in the main project page as to what is downloaded and what purpose it serves
 * <li>Downloaded content must be performed over HTTPS connections
 * <li>Downloaded content must not be hosted in a location that will limit downloads (e.g. DropBox, Google Drive)
 * </ul>
 * This GIST is supposed to help you with hashing files you want to download.
